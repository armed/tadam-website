HTML templates can be displayed in **raw**, rendered **using parameters** or different **layouts**. On the other hand it is also possible to return **Markdown** or **JSON**.

All templates should be located in **/resources/templates/**.

The syntax is inspired by Django. It is generated by [Selmer](https://github.com/yogthos/Selmer), you can consult its documentation for more advanced topics such as loops or filters.

## HTML

Suppose you have an HTML template in the **/resources/templates/theatre.html** path.

``` django
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>
        Tadam is magic.
    </body>
</html>
```

To invoke it I only have to import the function **render-HTML**.

``` clojure
(render-HTML [request] [path] [args]))
```

Example

``` clojure
[tadam.templates :refer [render-HTML]]

(defn index
  ;; View HTML
  [req]
  (render-HTML req "theatre.html" {}))
```

## HTML with params

Suppose you have an HTML template in the **/resources/templates/theatre.html** path.

``` django
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>
         <p>The {{ name }} Theatre was founded in {{ opened }} and currently has {{ surface }} seats.</p> 
    </body>
</html>
```

The View would be similar to the previous example but indicating its parameters.

``` clojure
(defn index
    ;; View HTML
    [req]
    (render-HTML req "theatre.html" {
    :name "Olympia"
    :opened 1915
    :surface 500
    }))
```

As a result I would return in the request.

``` django
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>
         <p>The Olympia Theatre was founded in 1915 and currently has 500 seats.</p> 
    </body>
</html>
```

## HTML in layout


## Markdown

It is possible to use Markdown files that will be transformed into HTML.

``` clojure
[tadam.templates :refer [render-markdown]]

(render-markdown req "theatre.md" {})
```

## JSON

A function is available to convert collections into JSON.

``` clojure
(render-JSON [request] [collection]))
```

Example

``` clojure
[tadam.templates :refer [render-JSON]]

(render-JSON req {
    :name "Olympia"
    :surface 500
    :opened 1915
    })
```

It will return a nice JSON with the right header.

``` json
{
  "name": "Olympia",
  "surface": 500,
  "opened": 1915
}
```
