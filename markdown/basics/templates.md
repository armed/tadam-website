HTML templates can be displayed in **raw**, rendered **using parameters** or different **layouts**. On the other hand it is also possible to return **Markdown** or **JSON**.

All templates should be located in **/resources/templates/**.

The syntax is inspired by Django. It is generated by [Selmer](https://github.com/yogthos/Selmer), you can consult its documentation for more advanced topics such as loops or filters.

## HTML

Suppose you have an HTML template in the **/resources/templates/theatre.html** path.

``` django
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>
        Tadam is magic.
    </body>
</html>
```

To invoke it I only have to import the function **render-HTML**.

``` clojure
(render-HTML [request] [path] [args]))
```

Example

``` clojure
[tadam.templates :refer [render-HTML]]

(defn index
  ;; View HTML
  [req]
  (render-HTML req "theatre.html" {}))
```

## HTML with params

Suppose you have an HTML template in the **/resources/templates/theatre.html** path.

``` django
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>
         <p>The {{ name }} Theatre was founded in {{ opened }} and currently has {{ surface }} seats.</p> 
    </body>
</html>
```

The View would be similar to the previous example but indicating its parameters.

``` clojure
(defn index
    ;; View HTML
    [req]
    (render-HTML req "theatre.html" {
    :name "Olympia"
    :opened 1915
    :surface 500
    }))
```

As a result I would return in the request.

``` django
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>
         <p>The Olympia Theatre was founded in 1915 and currently has 500 seats.</p> 
    </body>
</html>
```

## HTML in layout

In case you need to repeat the same HTML structure, it is possible to extend a template.In case you need to repeat the same HTML structure, it is possible to extend a template or to define which zones will change in each page.

I create a template in `/resources/templates/layouts/base.html` that will be my reference to generate new ones. It will contain everything that is repetitive: header, footer, navs... You define the zones, or `block`s, where you want to add the HTML.

``` django
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/main.css">
    <script src="/js/main.js"> </script>
    <title>{% block title %}{% endblock %} | Olympia Theatre</title>
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="/">Welcome</a></li>
                <li><a href="/programme">Programme</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
    </header>
    <main>
        {% block content %}{% endblock %}
    </main>
    <footer>
        More information in our newsletter
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

Now it's time to define the page that will extend `base.html`, it will be in the `/resources/templates/public/welcome.html` path.


``` django
{% extends "layouts/base.html" %}

{% block title %}
Welcome
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
<h1 class="title-welcome">Welcome to Tadam Framework </h1>
<p class="logo-welcome">
    <img class="logo-welcome" alt="Tadam" src="/img/tadam.svg">
</p>
{% endblock %}
```

## Markdown

It is possible to use Markdown files that will be transformed into HTML.

``` clojure
[tadam.templates :refer [render-markdown]]

(render-markdown req "theatre.md" {})
```

## JSON

A function is available to convert collections into JSON.

``` clojure
(render-JSON [request] [collection]))
```

Example

``` clojure
[tadam.templates :refer [render-JSON]]

(render-JSON req {
    :name "Olympia"
    :surface 500
    :opened 1915
    })
```

It will return a nice JSON with the right header.

``` json
{
  "name": "Olympia",
  "surface": 500,
  "opened": 1915
}
```
